1991,English Alphabet Recognition with Telephone Speech,"Mark Fanty, Ronald Cole, Krist Roginski",3,"A recognition system is reported which recognizes names spelled over the  telephone with brief pauses between letters. The system uses separate  neural networks to locate segment boundaries and classify letters. The  letter scores are then used to search a database of names to find the best  scoring name. The speaker-independent classification rate for spoken let(cid:173) ters is 89%. The system retrieves the correct name, spelled with pauses  between letters, 91 % of the time from a database of 50,000 names.",0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1991/file/01f78be6f7cad02658508fe4616098a9-Paper.pdf
1991,Recognizing Overlapping Hand-Printed Characters by Centered-Object Integrated Segmentation and Recognition,"Gale L. Martin, Mosfeq Rashid",2,"This paper describes an approach, called centered object integrated seg(cid:173) mentation and recognition (COISR). for integrating object segmenta(cid:173) tion and recognition within a single neural network. The application  is hand-printed character recognition. 1\vo versions of the system are  described. One uses a backpropagation network that scans exhaus(cid:173) tively over a field of characters and is trained to recognize whether  it is centered over a single character or between characters. When  it is centered over a character, the net classifies the cnaracter. The  approach is tested on a dataset of hand-printed digits. Vel)' low errOr  rates are reported. The second version, COISR-SACCADE, avoids  the need for exhaustive scans. The net is trained as before. but also  is trained to compute ballistic 'eye' movements that enable the input  window to jump from one character to the next.

1991,Node Splitting: A Constructive Algorithm for Feed-Forward Neural Networks,Mike Wynne-Jones,1,"A constructive algorithm is proposed for feed-forward neural networks,  which uses node-splitting in the hidden layers to build large networks from  smaller ones. The small network forms an approximate model of a set of  training data, and the split creates a larger more powerful network which is  initialised with the approximate solution already found. The insufficiency  of the smaller network in modelling the system which generated the data  leads to oscillation in those hidden nodes whose weight vectors cover re(cid:173) gions in the input space where more detail is required in the model. These  nodes are identified and split in two using principal component analysis,  allowing the new nodes t.o cover the two main modes of each oscillating  vector. Nodes are selected for splitting using principal component analysis  on the oscillating weight vectors, or by examining the Hessian matrix of  second derivatives of the network error with respect to the weight.s. The  second derivat.ive method can also be applied to the input layer, where it  provides a useful indication of t.he relative import.ances of parameters for  the classification t.ask. Node splitting in a standard Multi Layer Percep(cid:173) t.ron is equivalent to introducing a hinge in the decision boundary to allow  more detail to be learned. Initial results were promising, but further eval(cid:173) uation indicates that the long range effects of decision boundaries cause  the new nodes to slip back to the old node position, and nothing is gained.  This problem does not occur in networks of localised receptive fields such  as radial basis functions or gaussian mixtures, where the t.echnique appears  to work well.",0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1991/file/0fcbc61acd0479dc77e3cccc0f5ffca7-Paper.pdf

In this paper, we propose the prediction risk as a measure  of the generalization ability of multi-layer perceptron networks and use it  to select an optimal network architecture from a set of possible architec(cid:173) tures. We also propose a heuristic search strategy to explore the space of  possible architectures. The prediction risk is estimated from the available  data; here we estimate the prediction risk by v-fold cross-validation and  by asymptotic approximations of generalized cross-validation or Akaike's  final prediction error. We apply the technique to the problem of predicting  corporate bond ratings. This problem is very attractive as a case study,  since it is characterized by the limited availability of the data and by the  lack of a complete a priori model which could be used to impose a structure  to the network architecture.

In  contrast to this approach, we study here how the overall network activity  can control single cell parameters such as input resistance, as well as time  and space constants, parameters that are crucial for excitability and spatio(cid:173) temporal integration. Using detailed computer simulations of neocortical  pyramidal cells, we show that the spontaneous background firing of the  network provides a means for setting these parameters.

1991,Learning in Feedforward Networks with Nonsmooth Functions,"Nicholas Redding, T. Downs",2,"This paper is concerned with the problem of learning in networks where some  or all of the functions involved are not smooth. Examples of such networks are  those whose neural transfer functions are piecewise-linear and those whose error  function is defined in terms of the 100 norm.  Up to now, networks whose neural transfer functions are piecewise-linear have  received very little consideration in the literature, but the possibility of using an  error function defined in terms of the 100 norm has received some attention. In  this latter work, however, the problems that can occur when gradient methods are  used for non smooth error functions have not been addressed.  In this paper we draw upon some recent results from the field of nonsmooth  optimization (NSO) to present an algorithm for the non smooth case. Our moti(cid:173) vation for this work arose out of the fact that we have been able to show that,  in backpropagation, an error function based upon the 100 norm overcomes the  difficulties which can occur when using the 12 norm.",0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1991/file/1be3bc32e6564055d5ca3e5a354acbef-Paper.pdf

1991,Shooting Craps in Search of an Optimal Strategy for Training Connectionist Pattern Classifiers,"J. B. Hampshire II, B. Kumar",2,We compare two strategies for training connectionist (as well as non(cid:173) connectionist) models for statistical pattern recognition. The probabilistic strat(cid:173) egy is based on the notion that Bayesian discrimination (i.e .‚Ä¢ optimal classifica(cid:173) tion) is achieved when the classifier learns the a posteriori class distributions of  the random feature vector. The differential strategy is based on the notion that  the identity of the largest class a posteriori probability of the feature vector is  all that is needed to achieve Bayesian discrimination. Each strategy is directly  linked to a family of objective functions that can be used in the supervised training  procedure. We prove that the probabilistic strategy - linked with error measure  objective functions such as mean-squared-error and cross-entropy - typically  used to train classifiers necessarily requires larger training sets and more complex  classifier architectures than those needed to approximate the Bayesian discrim(cid:173) linked  inant function.  In contrast. we prove that the differential strategy - with classificationfigure-of-merit objective functions (CF'MmoIlO) [3] - requires  the minimum classifier functional complexity and the fewest training examples  necessary to approximate the Bayesian discriminant function with specified pre(cid:173) cision (measured in probability of error). We present our proofs in the context of  a game of chance in which an unfair C-sided die is tossed repeatedly. We show  that this rigged game of dice is a paradigm at the root of all statistical pattern  recognition tasks. and demonstrate how a simple extension of the concept leads  us to a general information-theoretic model of sample complexity for statistical  pattern recognition.,0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1991/file/250cf8b51c773f3f8dc8b4be867a9a02-Paper.pdf

1991,Some Approximation Properties of Projection Pursuit Learning Networks,"Ying Zhao, Christopher Atkeson",2,This paper will address an important question in machine learning:  What  kind  of network architectures  work  better on  what  kind  of problems?  A  projection pursuit  learning  network  has  a  very similar  structure to a  one  hidden  layer  sigmoidal  neural  network.  A  general  method  based  on  a  continuous  version  of projection  pursuit  regression  is  developed  to  show  that  projection  pursuit  regression  works  better  on angular  smooth func(cid:173) tions  than on  Laplacian  smooth functions.

1991,Unsupervised learning of distributions on binary vectors using two layer networks,"Yoav Freund, David Haussler",2,We study a particular type of Boltzmann machine with a bipartite graph structure called a harmo(cid:173) nium. Our interest is in using such a machine to model a probability distribution on binary input  vectors. We analyze the class of probability distributions that can be modeled by such machines.  showing that for each n ~ 1 this class includes arbitrarily good appwximations to any distribution  on the set of all n-vectors of binary inputs. We then present two learning algorithms for these  machines .. The first learning algorithm is the standard gradient ascent heuristic for computing  maximum likelihood estimates for the parameters (i.e. weights and thresholds) of the modeL Here  we give a closed form for this gradient that is significantly easier to compute than the corresponding  gradient for the general Boltzmann machine . The second learning algorithm is a greedy method  that creates the hidden units and computes their weights one at a time. This method is a variant  of the standard method for projection pursuit density estimation . We give experimental results for  these learning methods on synthetic data and natural data from the domain of handwritten digits.,0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1991/file/33e8075e9970de0cfea955afd4644bb2-Paper.pdf

1991,Neural Computing with Small Weights,"Kai-Yeung Siu, Jehoshua Bruck",2,"An important issue in neural computation is the dynamic range of weights  in  the  neural  networks.  Many  experimental  results  on  learning  indicate  that  the  weights  in  the  networks  can  grow  prohibitively  large  with  the  size  of the  inputs.  Here  we  address  this  issue  by  studying  the  tradeoffs  between  the  depth  and  the  size  of weights  in  polynomial-size  networks  of linear  threshold  elements  (LTEs).  We  show  that  there  is  an  efficient  way  of simulating  a  network  of LTEs  with  large  weights  by  a  network  of LTEs  with  small weights.  In  particular,  we  prove  that  every  depth-d,  polynomial-size network  of LTEs  with  exponentially  large  integer  weights  can  be  simulated  by  a  depth-(2d + 1),  polynomial-size network  of LTEs  with  polynomially  bounded  integer  weights.  To  prove  these  results,  we  use  tools from  harmonic analysis of Boolean  functions.  Our  technique  is  quite  general,  it  provides  insights  to some other  problems.  For  example,  we  are  able to improve the  best  known  results  on  the  depth  of a  network  of linear  threshold  elements  that  computes the  COM PARI SO N,  SUM  and  PRO DU CT of two  n-bits  numbers,  and  the  MAX 1M U M  and  the  SORTING of n  n-bit numbers.",0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1991/file/37f0e884fbad9667e38940169d0a3c95-Paper.pdf

1991,Induction of Multiscale Temporal Structure,Michael C. Mozer,1,"Learning  structure  in  temporally-extended  sequences  is  a  difficult  com(cid:173) putational problem because  only a  fraction  of the relevant  information is  available  at  any  instant.  Although  variants  of back  propagation  can  in  principle  be  used  to find  structure in  sequences,  in  practice  they  are  not  sufficiently  powerful  to  discover  arbitrary  contingencies,  especially  those  spanning  long  temporal  intervals  or  involving  high  order  statistics.  For  example,  in  designing  a  connectionist  network for  music  composition,  we  have encountered  the problem that the net is  able to learn  musical struc(cid:173) ture that occurs locally in time-e.g., relations  among notes within a  mu(cid:173) sical phrase-but not structure that occurs over longer time periods--e.g.,  relations  among  phrases.  To  address  this  problem,  we  require  a  means  of constructing  a  reduced  deacription  of the  sequence  that  makes  global  aspects more explicit  or more readily detectable.  I propose to achieve this  using hidden  units that operate with different  time constants.

A number of important  practical issues are identified and discussed from a general theoretical per(cid:173) spective.  These practical issues are then examined in the context of a case  study  in  which  TO(')  is  applied  to  learning  the  game  of backgammon  from  the  outcome of self-play.  This is  apparently  the  first  application of  this  algorithm  to  a  complex  nontrivial  task.  It is  found  that,  with  zero  knowledge  built  in,  the network  is able  to learn  from  scratch  to  play  the  entire game at a  fairly strong intermediate level of performance,  which  is  clearly  better  than conventional commercial programs, and which  in fact  surpasses  comparable networks  trained  on  a  massive  human expert  data  set.  The hidden  units in  these network  have apparently discovered  useful  features,  a  longstanding  goal of computer  games  research.

1991,A Network of Localized Linear Discriminants,Martin Glassman,1,"The localized linear discriminant network (LLDN) has been designed to address  classification problems containing relatively closely  spaced data from  different  classes  (encounter zones  [1], the accuracy problem  [2]).  Locally trained hyper(cid:173) plane segments are an effective way to define the decision boundaries for these  regions [3].  The LLD uses a modified perceptron training algorithm for effective  discovery of separating hyperplane/sigmoid units within narrow boundaries. The  basic unit of the network is the discriminant receptive field (DRF) which combines  the LLD function with Gaussians representing the dispersion of the local training  data with respect to the hyperplane.  The DRF implements a local distance mea(cid:173) sure [4], and obtains the benefits of networks oflocalized units [5].  A constructive  algorithm for the two-class case is described which incorporates DRF's into the  hidden layer to solve local discrimination problems.  The output unit produces a  smoothed, piecewise linear decision boundary.  Preliminary results  indicate the  ability of the LLDN to efficiently achieve separation when boundaries are narrow  and complex,  in  cases where  both the ""standard"" multilayer perceptron (MLP)  and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) yield high error rates on training data.

Therefore, to develop a fast  forward algorithm is a challenging task. In this paper w~ proposed a forward  learning algorithm which is one order faster (only 0(fV3) operations for each  time step) than the sensitivity matrix algorithm.
