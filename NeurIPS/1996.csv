1996,Hebb Learning of Features based on their Information Content,"Ferdinand Peper, Hideki Noda",2,"This  paper  investigates  the  stationary  points  of a  Hebb  learning  rule  with  a  sigmoid  nonlinearity  in  it.  We  show  mathematically  that  when  the  input  has  a  low  information  content,  as  measured  by  the  input's  variance,  this learning rule suppresses learning,  that is,  forces the weight  vector  to  converge  to  the  zero  vector.  When  the  information  content  exceeds  a  certain  value,  the  rule  will  automatically  begin  to  learn  a  feature in the input.  Our analysis suggests that under certain conditions  it  is  the  first  principal  component  that  is  learned.  The  weight  vector  length  remains  bounded,  provided  the  variance  of  the  input  is  finite.  Simulations confirm the theoretical results derived.",0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1996/file/0188e8b8b014829e2fa0f430f0a95961-Paper.pdf
1996,A Variational Principle for Model-based Morphing,"Lawrence Saul, Michael Jordan",2,"Given  a  multidimensional  data  set  and  a  model  of  its  density,  we  consider  how  to  define  the  optimal interpolation  between  two  points.  This is done by assigning a cost to each path through space,  based on two competing goals-one to interpolate through regions  of high  density,  the other  to minimize arc  length.  From this  path  functional,  we  derive  the  Euler-Lagrange  equations  for  extremal  motionj given two points, the desired  interpolation is found by solv(cid:173) ing a boundary value problem.  We show that this interpolation can  be done efficiently, in high dimensions, for Gaussian, Dirichlet, and  mixture models.",0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1996/file/018b59ce1fd616d874afad0f44ba338d-Paper.pdf

The information  maximization and minimization are performed on two different lev(cid:173) els:  collective and individual level.  Thus, two kinds  of information:  collective and  individual  information  are  defined.  By  maximizing  collective  information  and  by  minimizing  individual  information,  simple  networks  can  be  generated  in  terms  of the  number  of con(cid:173) nections  and  the  number  of hidden  units.  Obtained  networks  are  expected  to give better generalization and improved interpretation  of internal representations.  This method  was applied  to the infer(cid:173) ence  of the  maximum onset  principle  of an artificial  language.  In  this  problem,  it  was  shown  that  the  individual  information  min(cid:173) imization  is  not  contradictory  to  the  collective  information  max(cid:173) imization.

When  the  prediction  of future  returns  for  different  stocks  are viewed  as  different  tasks,  sharing  some  parameters  across  stocks  is  a  form  of multi-task  learning.

1996,Cholinergic Modulation Preserves Spike Timing Under Physiologically Realistic Fluctuating Input,"Akaysha Tang, Andreas Bartels, Terrence J. Sejnowski",3,"Neuromodulation  can  change  not  only  the  mean  firing  rate  of a  neuron,  but  also  its  pattern  of firing .  Therefore,  a  reliable  neu(cid:173) ral  coding  scheme,  whether  a  rate  coding  or  a  spike  time  based  coding,  must  be  robust  in  a  dynamic  neuromodulatory  environ(cid:173) ment.  The common observation that cholinergic modulation leads  to  a  reduction  in  spike  frequency  adaptation  implies  a  modifica(cid:173) tion  of spike  timing,  which  would  make  a  neural  code  based  on  precise spike timing difficult to maintain.  In this paper, the effects  of cholinergic modulation were  studied to test  the hypothesis that  precise  spike timing can serve  as a  reliable neural code.  Using  the  whole  cell  patch-clamp technique  in rat neocortical  slice  prepara(cid:173) tion and compartmental modeling techniques,  we show that cholin(cid:173) ergic  modulation, surprisingly,  preserved  spike  timing in response  to a fluctuating  inputs that resembles  in  vivo conditions.

1996,Multidimensional Triangulation and Interpolation for Reinforcement Learning,Scott Davies,1,"Dynamic  Programming,  Q-Iearning  and  other  discrete  Markov  Decision  Process  solvers  can be -applied to continuous d-dimensional state-spaces  by  quantizing the state space into an array of boxes.  This is often problematic  above  two dimensions:  a  coarse  quantization can lead  to poor policies, and  fine  quantization is too expensive.  Possible solutions are variable-resolution  discretization,  or function  approximation  by  neural  nets.  A  third option,  which  has  been  little  studied  in  the  reinforcement  learning  literature,  is  interpolation on  a  coarse  grid.  In  this  paper we  study  interpolation tech(cid:173) niques  that  can  result  in  vast  improvements in  the  online  behavior of the  resulting  control  systems:  multilinear  interpolation,  and  an  interpolation  algorithm  based  on  an  interesting  regular  triangulation  of d-dimensional  space.

1996,Learning from Demonstration,Stefan Schaal,1,"By  now  it is  widely  accepted  that learning  a  task  from  scratch,  i.e.,  without  any prior knowledge,  is a daunting  undertaking. Humans,  however,  rarely at(cid:173) tempt  to  learn  from  scratch.  They  extract  initial  biases  as  well  as  strategies  how  to  approach a learning problem from  instructions and/or demonstrations  of other  humans.  For  learning  control,  this  paper  investigates  how  learning  from  demonstration  can  be  applied  in  the  context of reinforcement  learning.  We  consider priming  the  Q-function,  the  value  function,  the  policy,  and  the  model of the task dynamics as possible areas where demonstrations can speed  up  learning.  In  general  nonlinear learning  problems,  only  model-based  rein(cid:173) forcement learning shows significant speed-up after a demonstration,  while in  the  special  case  of linear  quadratic  regulator  (LQR)  problems,  all  methods  profit  from  the  demonstration.

1996,Promoting Poor Features to Supervisors: Some Inputs Work Better as Outputs,"Rich Caruana, Virginia de Sa",2,"In supervised  learning there is  usually  a  clear  distinction  between  inputs  and  outputs - inputs are  what  you  will  measure,  outputs  are  what  you  will  predict  from  those  measurements.  This  paper  shows  that the distinction between  inputs  and  outputs is  not this  simple.  Some  features  are  more  useful  as  extra  outputs  than  as  inputs.  By using a feature  as  an output we  get  more than just the  case  values but can. learn a  mapping from  the other inputs to that  feature.  For many features  this mapping may be more useful  than  the  feature  value  itself.  We  present  two  regression  problems  and  one  classification problem  where  performance improves  if features  that  could  have  been  used  as  inputs  are  used  as  extra  outputs  instead.

1996,Practical Confidence and Prediction Intervals,Tom Heskes,1,"We  propose  a  new  method to compute prediction intervals.

The  confidence  interval  follows  from the variation in an ensemble of neural networks,  each of them  trained and stopped on bootstrap replicates of the original data set.  A second improvement is the use of the residuals on validation pat(cid:173) terns  instead of on training patterns for  estimation of the variance  of the  target  distribution.  As  illustrated  on  a  synthetic  example,  our method is  better than existing methods with regard to extrap(cid:173) olation and interpolation in data regimes with a limited amount of  data, and yields prediction intervals which  actual confidence  levels  are closer  to the desired  confidence  levels.

1996,Exploiting Model Uncertainty Estimates for Safe Dynamic Control Learning,Jeff Schneider,1,"Model  learning combined  with  dynamic  programming has  been  shown  to  be effective  for  learning control  of continuous state dynamic systems.  The  simplest method assumes the learned model is correct  and applies dynamic  programming to it, but many approximators provide uncertainty estimates  on  the  fit.  How  can  they  be  exploited?  This  paper  addresses  the  case  where the system must be prevented from having catastrophic failures dur(cid:173) ing learning.  We  propose  a  new  algorithm adapted  from  the  dual  control  literature  and  use  Bayesian  locally  weighted  regression  models  with  dy(cid:173) namic programming.

1996,A New Approach to Hybrid HMM/ANN Speech Recognition using Mutual Information Neural Networks,"Gerhard Rigoll, Christoph Neukirchen",2,"This paper presents a new approach to speech recognition with hybrid  HMM/ANN  technology.  While  the  standard  approach  to  hybrid  HMMI ANN  systems  is  based  on  the  use  of  neural  networks  as  posterior probability estimators, the new approach is based on the use  of mutual information neural  networks trained with a special learning  algorithm  in  order to  maximize the  mutual  information  between  the  input classes of the network and its resulting sequence of firing output  neurons  during  training.  It is  shown  in  this  paper that  such  a  neural  network  is  an  optimal  neural  vector quantizer for  a  discrete  hidden  Markov  model  system  trained  on  Maximum  Likelihood  principles.  One  of the  main  advantages  of this  approach  is  the  fact,  that  such  neural  networks  can  be  easily  combined  with  HMM's  of  any  complexity  with context-dependent capabilities.  It is  shown  that  the  resulting  hybrid  system  achieves  very  high  recognition  rates,  which  are  now  already  on  the  same  level  as  the  best  conventional  HMM  systems  with  continuous  parameters,  and  the  capabilities  of  the  mutual information neural networks are not yet entirely exploited.",0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1996/file/9a3d458322d70046f63dfd8b0153ece4-Paper.pdf

1996,Adaptive Access Control Applied to Ethernet Data,Timothy Brown,1,"This paper presents a method that decides which combinations of traffic  can be accepted on a packet data link,  so that quality of service  (QoS)  constraints can be met. The method uses samples of QoS  results at dif(cid:173) ferent load conditions to build a neural  network decision function.  Pre(cid:173) vious  similar approaches  to  the  problem  have  a  significant  bias.  This  bias is likely to  occur in any real system and results in accepting loads  that miss QoS targets by orders of magnitude. Preprocessing the data to  either remove  the  bias  or provide  a  confidence  level,  the  method  was  applied  to  sources  based  on  difficult-to-analyze  ethernet  data  traces.  With this data, the method produces an accurate access control function  that  dramatically  outperforms  analytic  alternatives.  Interestingly,  the  results depend on throwing away more than 99% of the data.",0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1996/file/b51a15f382ac914391a58850ab343b00-Paper.pdf

In  the  Bayesian  approach  a  Markov  Chain  Monte  Carlo  Model  Composition  (MC3)  algorithm  is  applied  to  search  over  connectivity  structures  and  Laplace's  method  is  used  to  approximate their posterior probability.

1996,Interpolating Earth-science Data using RBF Networks and Mixtures of Experts,"Ernest Wan, Don Bone",2,"We present a mixture of experts (ME) approach to interpolate sparse,  spatially correlated earth-science data. Kriging is an interpolation  method which uses a global covariation model estimated from the data  to take account of the spatial dependence in the data. Based on the  close relationship between kriging and the radial basis function (RBF)  network (Wan & Bone, 1996), we use a mixture of generalized RBF  networks to partition the input space into statistically correlated  regions and learn the local covariation model of the data in each  region. Applying the ME approach to simulated and real-world data,  we show that it is able to achieve good partitioning of the input space,  learn the local covariation models and improve generalization.",0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1996/file/f09696910bdd874a99cd74c8f05b5c44-Paper.pdf
1996,Statistically Efficient Estimations Using Cortical Lateral Connections,"Alexandre Pouget, Kechen Zhang",2,"Coarse  codes  are  widely  used  throughout  the  brain to encode  sen(cid:173) sory  and  motor  variables.  Methods  designed  to  interpret  these  codes,  such  as population vector analysis, are either inefficient, i.e.,  the variance of the estimate is much larger than the smallest possi(cid:173) ble  variance,  or biologically implausible, like  maximum likelihood.  Moreover,  these  methods  attempt  to  compute  a  scalar  or  vector  estimate  of the  encoded  variable.  Neurons  are  faced  with  a  simi(cid:173) lar  estimation problem .  They  must  read  out  the  responses  of the  presynaptic  neurons,  but,  by  contrast,  they  typically  encode  the  variable  with  a  further  population  code  rather  than  as  a  scalar.  We  show  how  a  non-linear  recurrent  network  can  be  used  to  per(cid:173) form these estimation in an optimal way while keeping the estimate  in  a  coarse  code  format.  This  work  suggests  that  lateral  connec(cid:173) tions  in  the  cortex  may  be  involved  in  cleaning  up  uncorrelated  noise  among neurons  representing  similar variables.",0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1996/file/f29b38f160f87ae86df31cee1982066f-Paper.pdf

If a polyhedral distance is  used,  the problem  can be formulated as that of minimizing a piecewise-linear concave  function  on  a  polyhedral  set  which  is  shown  to  be  equivalent  to  a  bilinear  program:  minimizing  a  bilinear  function  on  a  polyhe(cid:173) dral  set.

1996,Edges are the 'Independent Components' of Natural Scenes.,"Anthony Bell, Terrence J. Sejnowski",2,"Field  (1994)  has  suggested  that  neurons  with  line  and  edge  selectivities  found  in  primary  visual  cortex  of  cats  and  monkeys  form  a  sparse,  dis(cid:173) tributed representation of natural scenes,  and Barlow  (1989)  has  reasoned  that such responses should emerge from an unsupervised learning algorithm  that attempts to find  a  factorial  code  of independent  visual  features.  We  show  here  that non-linear  'infomax',  when  applied  to  an ensemble  of nat(cid:173) ural  scenes,  produces  sets of visual  filters  that are localised  and oriented.  Some  of these  filters  are  Gabor-like  and  resemble  those  produced  by  the  sparseness-maximisation network of Olshausen & Field (1996).  In addition,  the outputs  of these filters  are as  independent  as  possible,  since  the info(cid:173) max network is  able to perform Independent Components Analysis  (ICA).  We  compare the resulting ICA filters  and their associated basis  functions,  with other decorrelating filters produced by Principal Components Analysis  (PCA)  and zero-phase whitening filters  (ZCA).  The ICA filters  have more  sparsely distributed (kurtotic) outputs on natural scenes.  They also resem(cid:173) ble the receptive fields  of simple  cells  in  visual  cortex,  which  suggests that  these neurons form an information-theoretic co-ordinate system for images.

1996,For Valid Generalization the Size of the Weights is More Important than the Size of the Network,Peter Bartlett,1,"This paper shows that if a large neural network is used for a pattern  classification  problem, and the learning algorithm finds  a  network  with  small  weights  that  has  small  squared  error  on  the  training  patterns,  then  the generalization performance depends  on the size  of the  weights  rather  than  the  number  of weights.  More  specifi(cid:173) cally,  consider  an i-layer feed-forward  network of sigmoid units, in  which  the  sum  of the  magnitudes  of the  weights  associated  with  each  unit is  bounded  by  A.  The  misclassification probability con(cid:173) verges  to an error estimate (that is closely  related to squared error  on  the  training  set)  at  rate  O((cA)l(l+1)/2J(log n)jm)  ignoring  log  factors,  where  m  is  the  number of training  patterns,  n  is  the  input  dimension,  and  c is  a  constant.  This may explain  the  gen(cid:173) eralization performance of neural  networks,  particularly when  the  number of training examples is considerably smaller than the num(cid:173) ber  of weights.
