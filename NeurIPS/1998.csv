However, be(cid:173) cause of the separation between excitation and inhibition, biolog(cid:173) ical  neural networks  are  asymmetrical.  We  study characteristic  differences between asymmetrical networks and their symmetri(cid:173) cal  counterparts,  showing  that  they  have  dramatically  different  dynamical behavior and also how the differences can be exploited  for computational ends.

Our  method  extends  existing  deterministic  methods, including agglomerative algorithms, min-cut graph  algo(cid:173) rithms,  and  connected  components.  Thus  it  provides  a  common  framework for  all  these  methods.  Our  graph-based  method  differs  from  existing  stochastic  methods  which  are  based  on  analogy  to  physical  systems.  The  stochastic  nature  of our  method  makes  it  more  robust  against  noise,  including  accidental  edges  and  small  spurious clusters.

Detec(cid:173) tion systems which automatically detect illegal use of the network can be  used to alleviate the problem. Previous approaches worked on features  derived from the call patterns of individual users. In this paper we present  a call-based detection system based on a hierarchical regime-switching  model. The detection problem is formulated as an inference problem on  the regime probabilities. Inference is implemented by applying the junc(cid:173) tion tree algorithm to the underlying graphical model.

These are  dictated  by  the properties of the tissue,  the electrodes  and  their relative  geometries.

The parameters  of  the Gaussian approximation are either derived from the extended Kalman  filter or the Fisher scoring algorithm. In case the posterior density is mul(cid:173) timodal  we propose to  approximate the posterior by  a sum of Gaussians  (mixture of modes approach).

Three  models are explored. The first model maintains no inter-pixel dependencies, the  second model is capable of modeling a set of arbitrary pair-wise dependencies,  and the last model allows  dependencies  only  between  neighboring pixels. We  show that for all three of these models, the accuracy of the learned models can  be greatly improved by  augmenting a small number of labeled training images  with  a  large  set of unlabeled  images using  Expectation-Maximization.  This  is  important because it is often difficult to obtain image labels, while many unla(cid:173) beled images  are  readily  available.  Through  a  large  set  of empirical  tests,  we  examine the benefits  of unlabeled data  for  each  of the  models.

The MAP estimate minimizes uncertainty  in  all  respects:  cross-entropy  between  model  and  data;  entropy  of the  model ;  entropy  of  the  data's  descriptive  statistics.  Iterative  estimation  extinguishes  weakly  supported  parameters,  compressing and  sparsifying  the  model.  Trimming operators  accelerate  this  process  by  removing  excess  parameters  and,  unlike  most  pruning  schemes,  guarantee  an  increase  in  posterior  probability.  Entropic  estimation  takes  a  overcomplete  random  model  and simplifies  it,  inducing the  structure of relations  between  hidden  and  observed  variables.  Applied  to  hidden  Markov  models  (HMMs),  it  finds  a  concise  finite-state  machine  representing  the  hidden  structure  of a  signal.

We  trained  subjects  to  discriminate  the  directions  of  moving  dots,  and  verified  the  previous  results  that learning does not transfer from the trained direction to a  new  one.

1998,Controlling the Complexity of HMM Systems by Regularization,"Christoph Neukirchen, Gerhard Rigoll",2,This paper introduces a method for regularization ofHMM systems that  avoids parameter overfitting caused by insufficient training data.  Regu(cid:173) larization is  done by augmenting the  EM  training method by a penalty  term  that  favors  simple  and  smooth HMM  systems.  The penalty  term  is  constructed as  a mixture model of negative exponential distributions  that is assumed to generate the state dependent emission probabilities of  the HMMs.  This new method is the successful transfer of a well known  regularization approach in neural networks to the HMM domain and can  be interpreted as a generalization of traditional state-tying for HMM sys(cid:173) tems.  The effect of regularization is demonstrated for continuous speech  recognition tasks by improving overfitted triphone models and by speaker  adaptation with limited training data.,0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1998/file/5607fe8879e4fd269e88387e8cb30b7e-Paper.pdf

Here  we  examine  two  adaptive control  architectures, one  based only on  the inverse model and other based on a combination of forward and  inverse  models.  We  then show that for  reaching movements of the  hand  in  novel  force  fields,  only  the  learning of the  forward  model  results  in  key  characteristics of performance  that match  the  kine(cid:173) matics of human subjects.  In  contrast, the adaptive control system  that relies only on the inverse model fails to produce the kinematic  patterns observed  in  the subjects,  despite the  fact  that it  is  more  stable.  Our results  provide evidence that learning control of novel  dynamics is  via formation of a  forward  model.",0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1998/file/86df7dcfd896fcaf2674f757a2463eba-Paper.pdf
1998,Restructuring Sparse High Dimensional Data for Effective Retrieval,"Charles Isbell, Paul Viola",2,"The task in text retrieval is to find  the subset of a collection of documents relevant  to  a user's  information request,  usually expressed as  a set of words.  Classically,  documents and queries are represented as  vectors of word counts.  In  its  simplest  form, relevance is  defined to be the dot product between a document and  a query  vector-a measure  of the  number of common  terms.  A  central  difficulty  in  text  retrieval  is  that  the  presence or absence  of a  word  is  not sufficient to  determine  relevance to a query. Linear dimensionality reduction has been proposed as a tech(cid:173) nique for extracting underlying structure from  the document collection.  In  some  domains  (such  as  vision)  dimensionality  reduction  reduces  computational com(cid:173) plexity.  In  text retrieval  it is  more often  used  to  improve retrieval  performance.  We  propose  an  alternative  and  novel  technique  that  produces  sparse  represen(cid:173) tations  constructed  from  sets  of highly-related  words.  Documents  and  queries  are  represented  by  their distance  to  these  sets,  and relevance  is  measured by  the  number of common clusters.

1998,Classification in Non-Metric Spaces,"Daphna Weinshall, David Jacobs, Yoram Gdalyahu",3,"A  key question in vision  is  how to represent our knowledge  of previously  encountered objects to classify new ones.  The answer depends on how we  determine  the similarity  of two  objects.  Similarity  tells  us how  relevant  each previously seen object is in determining the category to which a new  object belongs.  Here a  dichotomy  emerges.  Complex notions  of similar(cid:173) ity  appear necessary for  cognitive models  and applications,  while  simple  notions of similarity  form a tractable basis for current computational ap(cid:173) proaches  to classification.  We  explore  the  nature of this dichotomy  and  why  it  calls  for  new  approaches  to  well-studied  problems  in  learning.  We  begin  this  process  by  demonstrating  new  computational  methods  for  supervised  learning  that  can  handle  complex  notions  of similarity.

In [2], we describe  an approximate inference algorithm for monitoring stochastic processes,  and prove bounds on its approximation error.  In this paper, we apply this  algorithm as an approximate forward propagation step in an EM algorithm  for learning temporal Bayesian networks.  We provide a related approxi(cid:173) mation for the backward step, and prove error bounds for the  combined  algorithm.  We  show empirically that,  for a real-life domain,  EM  using  our inference algorithm  is  much  faster  than  EM  using exact inference,  with almost no degradation in quality of the learned model.  We  extend  our analysis  to  the  online learning  task,  showing a  bound  on  the  error  resulting  from  restricting  attention  to  a  small  window  of observations.

First,  what  kinds  of performance  guar(cid:173) antees  can  be  made  for  Q-learning  after  only  a  finite  number  of actions?  Second,  what  quantitative  comparisons  can  be  made  between  Q-learning  and  model-based  (indirect)  approaches,  which  use  experience  to estimate  next-state  distributions  for  off-line  value  iteration?  We  first  show  that  both  Q-learning  and  the  indirect  approach  enjoy  rather  rapid  convergence  to  the  optimal  policy  as  a  function  of the num(cid:173) ber  of  state  transitions  observed.  In  particular,  on  the  order  of  only  (Nlog(1/c)/c2 )(log(N) + loglog(l/c))  transitions  are  sufficient  for  both  algorithms  to  come  within  c  of the  optimal  policy,  in  an  idealized  model  that  assumes  the  observed  transitions  are  ""well-mixed""  throughout  an  N-state  MDP.

Perhaps  surprisingly,  this  sample  complexity  is  far less  than  what is required for the model-based approach to actually construct a good  approximation  to  the  next-state  distribution.

extracted from  visual scenes: Regularity in the relations among different 
parts of an  object is  weaker than in  the  internal  structure of a part. This 
principle  can  be  applied  recursively  to  define  part-whole  relationships 
among elements  in  a scene.  The principle does  not make use  of object

1998,Applications of Multi-Resolution Neural Networks to Mammography,"Clay Spence, Paul Sajda",2,"We  have  previously  presented  a  coarse-to-fine  hierarchical  pyra(cid:173) mid/neural  network  (HPNN)  architecture  which  combines  multi(cid:173) scale  image  processing  techniques  with  neural  networks.  In  this  paper  we  present  applications  of  this  general  architecture  to  two  problems  in  mammographic  Computer-Aided  Diagnosis  (CAD).  The  first  application  is  the  detection  of  microcalcifications.  The  <:oarse-to-fine  HPNN  was  designed  to learn  large-scale  context  in(cid:173) formation  for  detecting  small objects  like  microcalcifications.  Re(cid:173) ceiver  operating  characteristic  (ROC)  analysis  suggests  that  the  hierarchical  architecture  improves  detection  performance  of a  well  established  CAD  system by  roughly  50 %.

1998,A Phase Space Approach to Minimax Entropy Learning and the Minutemax Approximations,"James Coughlan, Alan L. Yuille",2,"There  has  been  much  recent  work  on  measuring  image  statistics  and  on  learning  probability  distributions  on  images.  We  observe  that  the  mapping  from  images  to  statistics  is  many-to-one  and  show  it  can  be  quantified  by  a  phase  space  factor.  This  phase  space approach throws light on the Minimax Entropy technique for  learning Gibbs distributions on images with potentials derived from  image statistics and elucidates the ambiguities that are inherent to  determining the potentials.  In  addition, it shows that if the phase  factor  can  be  approximated  by  an  analytic  distribution  then  this  approximation  yields  a  swift  ""Minutemax""  algorithm  that  vastly  reduces  the  computation  time  for  Minimax entropy  learning.  An  illustration  of this  concept,  using  a  Gaussian  to  approximate  the  phase  factor,  gives  a  good  approximation  to  the  results  of  Zhu  and  Mumford  (1997)  in  just  seconds  of  CPU  time.  The  phase  space  approach  also  gives  insight  into  the  multi-scale  potentials  found  by  Zhu and Mumford  (1997)  and suggests that the forms  of  the potentials are influenced greatly by phase space considerations.  Finally,  we  prove  that probability distributions  learned  in  feature  space  alone  are  equivalent  to  Minimax  Entropy  learning  with  a  multinomial approximation of the phase factor.",0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1998/file/bc573864331a9e42e4511de6f678aa83-Paper.pdf

For weak competition, it re(cid:173) sembles a correlation-based learning model and for strong competition,  it becomes a self-organizing map. Thus, in the regime of weak compe(cid:173) tition the receptive fields are shaped by the second order statistics of the  input patterns, whereas in the regime of strong competition, the higher  moments and ""features"" of the individual patterns become important.  When correlated localized stimuli from two eyes drive the cortical de(cid:173) velopment we find (i) that a topographic map and binocular, localized  receptive fields emerge when the degree of competition exceeds a critical  value and (ii) that receptive fields exhibit eye dominance beyond a sec(cid:173) ond critical value.

1998,The Effect of Eligibility Traces on Finding Optimal Memoryless Policies in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes,John Loch,1,"Agents  acting  in  the  real  world  are  confronted  with  the  problem  of  making  good  decisions  with  limited  knowledge  of the  environment.  Partially  observable  Markov  decision  processes  (POMDPs)  model  decision problems in which an  agent tries to maximize its reward in  the  face  of limited sensor feedback.  Recent work has shown empirically that  a  reinforcement  learning  (RL)  algorithm  called  Sarsa(A)  can  efficiently  find  optimal  memoryless  policies,  which  map  current  observations  to  actions,  for  POMDP  problems  (Loch  and  Singh  1998).  The  Sarsa(A)  algorithm uses a form  of short-term memory  called an eligibility trace,  which  distributes  temporally  delayed  rewards  to  observation-action  pairs  which  lead  up  to  the  reward.  This  paper  explores  the  effect  of  eligibility traces on the ability of the Sarsa(A) algorithm to find  optimal  memoryless  policies.  A  variant  of  Sarsa(A)  called  k-step  truncated  Sarsa(A)  is  applied to four test  problems taken  from  the  recent  work of  Littman,  Littman,  Cassandra  and  Kaelbling,  Parr  and  Russell,  and  Chrisman.

Uninformed LRTA * with  maximal  lookahead always moves  on a  shortest path to the closest unvisited  state,  that is, to the closest potential goal state.

Experimental  data  indicate  that (I) single  neurons  in  these  regions  are  broadly tuned to parameters of movement; (2) appropriate commands are  elaborated by  populations of neurons; (3) the coordinated action of neu(cid:173) rons can be  visualized  using a neuronal population vector (NPV).  How(cid:173) ever,  the  NPV  provides only  a rough  estimate  of movement parameters  (direction, velocity) and may even fail  to reflect the parameters of move(cid:173) ment when arm posture is changed.  We designed a model of the cortical  motor command to  investigate the relation between the desired direction  of the  movement, the  actual direction of movement and  the direction of  the NPV in  motor cortex.

Simulations  showed  that  (1)  the  network produced appropriate movement direction over a  large part  of the  workspace;  (2) small  deviations of the  actual  trajectory  from  the  desired  trajectory existed  at the extremities of the  workspace;  (3)  these  deviations were accompanied by  large deviations of the NPV from both  trajectories.
