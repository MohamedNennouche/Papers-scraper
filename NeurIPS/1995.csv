1995,Learning to Predict Visibility and Invisibility from Occlusion Events,"Jonathan Marshall, Richard Alley, Robert Hubbard",3,"Visual  occlusion  events  constitute  a  major source  of depth  information.  This paper presents a self-organizing neural network that learns to detect,  represent,  and predict the visibility and invisibility relationships that arise  during  occlusion  events,  after  a  period  of exposure  to  motion sequences  containing occlusion  and  disocclusion events.  The  network develops  two  parallel opponent  channels  or  ""chains""  of lateral  excitatory  connections  for  every  resolvable  motion trajectory.  One  channel,  the  ""On""  chain or  ""visible""  chain, is  activated when a moving stimulus is visible.  The other  channel, the  ""Off""  chain or  ""invisible""  chain,  carries  a persistent,  amodal  representation that predicts the motion of a formerly visible stimulus that  becomes  invisible  due  to occlusion.  The  learning  rule  uses  disinhibition  from  the  On  chain  to  trigger  learning  in  the  Off  chain.  The  On  and  Off chain  neurons  can  learn  separate  associations  with  object  depth  or(cid:173) dering.  The results  are closely  related  to the  recent  discovery  (Assad  &  Maunsell,  1995)  of neurons in macaque monkey posterior  parietal cortex  that respond selectively to inferred  motion of invisible stimuli.

1995,Onset-based Sound Segmentation,Leslie Smith,1,"A technique for  segmenting sounds using processing based on mam(cid:173) malian  early  auditory  processing  is  presented.  The  technique  is  based on features in sound which neuron spike recording suggests  are  detected in  the  cochlear  nucleus.  The  sound  signal  is  band(cid:173) passed  and  each  signal  processed  to  enhance  onsets  and  offsets.  The onset and offset signals are compressed, then clustered both in  time and  across  frequency  channels  using  a  network  of integrate(cid:173) and-fire  neurons.

1995,The Gamma MLP for Speech Phoneme Recognition,"Steve Lawrence, Ah Tsoi, Andrew Back",3,"We  define  a  Gamma  multi-layer  perceptron  (MLP)  as  an  MLP  with the usual synaptic weights replaced by gamma filters  (as pro(cid:173) posed by de Vries and Principe  (de Vries and Principe,  1992)) and  associated  gain  terms  throughout  all  layers.

1995,Laterally Interconnected Self-Organizing Maps in Hand-Written Digit Recognition,"Yoonsuck Choe, Joseph Sirosh, Risto Miikkulainen",3,"An  application  of  laterally  interconnected  self-organizing  maps  (LISSOM)  to handwritten  digit recognition  is  presented.  The lat(cid:173) eral connections  learn the correlations of activity between units on  the  map.  The  resulting  excitatory  connections  focus  the  activity  into local patches and the inhibitory connections decorrelate redun(cid:173) dant activity on the map.  The map thus forms internal representa(cid:173) tions that are easy to recognize with e.g.  a perceptron network.  The  recognition rate on a subset of NIST database 3 is 4.0% higher with  LISSOM  than  with  a  regular  Self-Organizing  Map  (SOM)  as  the  front  end,  and 15.8% higher than recognition of raw input bitmaps  directly.

We introduce a new model of parallelism, the Single  Function  Multiple  Data  (SFMD) model, appropriate to this stage.  SFMD functionality can be added with small hardware expense to  certain existing SIMD architectures, and as an incremental addition  to the programming model.  Adding  SFMD  to an SIMD  machine  will  not  only  allow  faster  model  matching,  but  also  increase  its  flexibility as a  general purpose machine and its scope in performing  the initial stages of sensory processing.",0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1995/file/0f2c9a93eea6f38fabb3acb1c31488c6-Paper.pdf

Solving  exactly  the  simple  model  of an  ensemble  of linear  students,  we  find  surprisingly  rich  behaviour.  For  learning  in  large  ensembles,  it  is  advantageous  to  use  under-regularized  students,  which  actu(cid:173) ally  over-fit  the  training data.  Globally optimal performance  can  be  obtained by  choosing  the training set  sizes  of the students ap(cid:173) propriately.  For  smaller ensembles,  optimization of the  ensemble  weights  can yield significant improvements in ensemble generaliza(cid:173) tion  performance,  in particular if the  individual students  are  sub(cid:173) ject to noise in the training process.

1995,Generating Accurate and Diverse Members of a Neural-Network Ensemble,"David Opitz, Jude Shavlik",2,"Neural-network  ensembles  have  been  shown  to  be  very  accurate  classification  techniques.  Previous  work  has  shown  that  an effec(cid:173) tive ensemble  should  consist  of networks  that are not  only  highly  correct,  but  ones  that  make  their  errors on  different  parts  of the  input  space  as  well.  Most  existing  techniques,  however,  only  in(cid:173) directly  address  the  problem  of  creating  such  a  set  of  networks.

1995,A Model of Spatial Representations in Parietal Cortex Explains Hemineglect,"Alexandre Pouget, Terrence J. Sejnowski",2,"We have recently developed a theory of spatial representations in  which the position of an object is not encoded in a particular frame  of reference but, instead, involves neurons computing basis func(cid:173) tions of their sensory inputs. This type of representation is able  to perform nonlinear sensorimotor transformations and is consis(cid:173) tent with the response properties of parietal neurons. We now ask  whether the same theory could account for the behavior of human  patients with parietal lesions. These lesions induce a deficit known  as hemineglect that is characterized by a lack of reaction to stimuli  located in the hemispace contralateral to the lesion. A simulated  lesion in a basis function representation was found to replicate three  of the most important aspects of hemineglect: i) The models failed  to cross the leftmost lines in line cancellation experiments, ii) the  deficit affected multiple frames of reference and, iii) it could be  object centered. These results strongly support the basis function  hypothesis for spatial representations and provide a computational  theory of hemineglect at the single cell level.",0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1995/file/1b0114c51cc532ed34e1954b5b9e4b58-Paper.pdf

Miller, Ajit Rao, Kenneth Rose, Allen Gersho",4,"A  new  learning  algorithm is  developed for  the design  of statistical  classifiers  minimizing  the  rate  of misclassification.  The  method,  which  is  based on  ideas  from  information  theory  and  analogies  to  statistical  physics,  assigns  data to  classes  in  probability.  The  dis(cid:173) tributions  are  chosen  to minimize the  expected  classification  error  while  simultaneously enforcing  the classifier's structure and a level  of ""randomness""  measured  by  Shannon's entropy.  Achievement of  the classifier structure is  quantified by an  associated cost.  The con(cid:173) strained optimization  problem is  equivalent to the minimization of  a  Helmholtz  free  energy,  and  the  resulting  optimization  method  is  a  basic  extension  of the  deterministic  annealing  algorithm  that  explicitly  enforces  structural  constraints on  assignments  while  re(cid:173) ducing  the  entropy  and  expected  cost  with  temperature.  In  the  limit of low temperature, the error rate is minimized directly and a  hard classifier with the requisite structure is  obtained.  This learn(cid:173) ing algorithm can be used to design a variety of classifier structures.  The approach is  compared with standard methods for  radial basis  function  design  and  is  demonstrated  to  substantially  outperform  other  design  methods  on  several  benchmark  examples,  while  of(cid:173) ten retaining design complexity comparable to,  or only moderately  greater than that of strict descent-based methods.

In addition, we  use a team  of RL  agents,  each  of which is  responsible  for  controlling one  ele(cid:173) vator car.  The team receives  a  global reinforcement  signal  which  appears noisy to each agent due to the effects of the actions of the  other agents, the random nature of the arrivals and the incomplete  observation of the state.

Saccades are known to be ballistic: the pattern of muscle activation  for foveating a prespecified target location is computed prior to the movement  and visual feedback is precluded. Despite these distinctive properties, there  has been no general model of the saccadic targeting strategy employed by  the human visual system during visual search in natural scenes. This paper  proposes a model for saccadic targeting that uses iconic scene representations  derived from oriented spatial filters at multiple scales. Visual search proceeds  in a coarse-to-fine fashion with the largest scale filter responses being compared  first. The model was empirically tested by comparing its perfonnance with  actual eye movement data from human subjects in a natural visual search task;  preliminary results indicate substantial agreement between eye movements  predicted by the model and those recorded from human subjects.",0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1995/file/3fe78a8acf5fda99de95303940a2420c-Paper.pdf

1995,Generalization in Reinforcement Learning: Successful Examples Using Sparse Coarse Coding,Richard S. Sutton,1,"On large  problems,  reinforcement  learning  systems  must  use  parame(cid:173) terized function approximators such as neural networks in order to gen(cid:173) eralize  between similar  situations and actions.  In these cases  there are  no strong theoretical results on the accuracy  of convergence,  and com(cid:173) putational results  have  been  mixed.  In  particular,  Boyan and  Moore  reported at last year's meeting a series of negative results in attempting  to apply dynamic programming together with function approximation  to simple control problems with continuous state spaces.  In this paper,  we present positive results for all the control tasks they attempted, and  for  one that is significantly larger.  The most important differences  are  that  we  used  sparse-coarse-coded  function  approximators  (CMACs)  whereas  they used mostly global function  approximators, and that we  learned  online  whereas  they  learned  offline.  Boyan  and  Moore  and  others  have  suggested  that  the  problems  they  encountered  could  be  solved  by  using  actual  outcomes  (""rollouts""),  as  in  classical  Monte  Carlo  methods,  and as in the TD().)  algorithm when). =  1.  However,  in our experiments  this always resulted in substantially poorer perfor(cid:173) mance.

The gain of the VOR (the ratio of eye to head rotation velocity)  is  typically around -1  when the eyes are focused on a distant target.  However, to  stabilize images accurately, the VOR gain must vary  with context (eye position,  eye vergence and head  translation).  We  first  describe  a  kinematic  model of the  VOR which relies solely on sensory information available from the semicircular  canals (head rotation), the otoliths (head translation), and neural correlates of eye  position and vergence angle.  We then propose a dynamical model and compare it  to the eye velocity responses measured in monkeys. The dynamical model repro(cid:173) duces the observed amplitude and time course of the modulation of the VOR and  suggests one way to combine the required neural signals within the cerebellum and  the brain stem.

Lifelong learning  addresses  situations  in  which  a  learner  faces  a  whole  stream  of learn(cid:173) ing tasks.

The  emphasis  is  that  such  learning  tasks  could  be  formulated  as  an  embedding  problem  of  dynamical  systems:  desired  trajectories  in  a  task space  should  be  embedded  into an  adequate  sensory-based internal  state  space  so  that an unique mapping from the internal state space to the motor  command could  be established.  The  paper shows that a  recurrent  neural network suffices in self-organizing such an adequate internal  state space  from  the temporal  sensory input.  In  our experiments,  using  a  real  robot  with  a  laser  range  sensor,  the  robot  navigated  robustly  by achieving dynamical coherence with  the environment.

1995,Optimization Principles for the Neural Code,Michael DeWeese,1,"Recent  experiments  show  that  the  neural  codes  at  work  in  a  wide  range of creatures share some common features.  At first sight, these  observations seem unrelated.  However,  we show  that these  features  arise naturally in  a linear filtered  threshold crossing  (LFTC) model  when we set the threshold to maximize the transmitted information.  This maximization process  requires  neural  adaptation  to  not only  the  DC  signal  level,  as  in  conventional  light  and  dark  adaptation,  but also to the statistical structure of the signal and noise distribu(cid:173) tions.  We  also  present  a  new  approach for  calculating the  mutual  information between  a  neuron's  output  spike  train and any aspect  of its  input signal  which  does not require  reconstruction  of the  in(cid:173) put  signal.  This formulation  is  valid  provided  the  correlations  in  the  spike  train are  small, and we  provide  a  procedure  for  checking  this  assumption.  This paper is  based  on joint work  (DeWeese  [1],  1995).

We present a framework for non-rigid match(cid:173) ing that begins with a skeleton module, affine point matching,  and then integrates multiple features to improve correspondence  and develops an object representation based on spatial regions to  model local transformations. The algorithm for feature matching  iteratively updates the transformation parameters and the corre(cid:173) spondence solution, each in turn. The affine mapping is solved in  closed form, which permits its use for data of any dimension. The  correspondence is set via a method for two-way constraint satisfac(cid:173) tion, called softassign, which has recently emerged from the neural  network/statistical physics realm. The complexity of the non-rigid  matching algorithm with multiple features is the same as that of  the affine point matching algorithm.

This  paper  suggests  that  the  human  reading  system  avoids  these  problems  because  the  number  of to-be-classified  im(cid:173) ages  is  reduced  by  consistent  and  optimal eye  fixation  positions,  and  by  character sequence  regularities.

1995,Unsupervised Pixel-prediction,William Softky,1,"When a sensory system constructs a model of the environment  from its input, it might need to verify the model's accuracy. One  method of verification is multivariate time-series prediction: a good  model could predict the near-future activity of its inputs, much  as a good scientific theory predicts future data. Such a predict(cid:173) ing model would require copious top-down connections to compare  the predictions with the input. That feedback could improve the  model's performance in two ways: by biasing internal activity to(cid:173) ward expected patterns, and by generating specific error signals if  the predictions fail. A proof-of-concept model-an event-driven,  computationally efficient layered network, incorporating ""cortical""  features like all-excitatory synapses and local inhibition- was con(cid:173) structed to make near-future predictions of a simple, moving stim(cid:173) ulus. After unsupervised learning, the network contained units not  only tuned to obvious features of the stimulus like contour orienta(cid:173) tion and motion, but also to contour discontinuity (""end-stopping"")  and illusory contours.",0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1995/file/e5e63da79fcd2bebbd7cb8bf1c1d0274-Paper.pdf
1995,"Control of Selective Visual Attention: Modeling the ""Where"" Pathway","Ernst Niebur, Christof Koch",2,"Intermediate and higher vision processes  require selection of a sub(cid:173) set  of the  available sensory  information  before  further  processing.  Usually,  this  selection  is  implemented  in  the  form  of a  spatially  circumscribed  region of the  visual field,  the  so-called  ""focus  of at(cid:173) tention""  which  scans  the  visual scene  dependent  on the  input  and  on the attentional state of the subject.  We here  present a  model for  the control of the focus of attention in primates, based on a saliency  map.  This mechanism is not only expected  to model the functional(cid:173) ity of biological vision but also to be essential for the understanding  of complex scenes  in machine vision.

1995,Quadratic-Type Lyapunov Functions for Competitive Neural Networks with Different Time-Scales,Anke Meyer-Bäse,1,The dynamics of complex neural networks modelling the self(cid:173) organization process in cortical maps must include the aspects of  long and short-term memory. The behaviour of the network is such  characterized by an equation of neural activity as a fast phenom(cid:173) enon and an equation of synaptic modification as a slow part of the  neural system. We present a quadratic-type Lyapunov function for  the flow of a competitive neural system with fast and slow dynamic  variables. We also show the consequences of the stability analysis  on the neural net parameters.,0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1995/file/eddb904a6db773755d2857aacadb1cb0-Paper.pdf
1995,Learning long-term dependencies is not as difficult with NARX networks,"Tsungnan Lin, Bill Horne, Peter Tiño, C.

Previous  work  reported that gradient descent learning is  more effective in NARX  networks  than  in  recurrent  networks  with  ""hidden  states"".  We  show  that although  NARX  networks  do  not  circumvent the  prob(cid:173) lem  of long-term dependencies,  they  can  greatly  improve  perfor(cid:173) mance  on  such  problems.

1995,Information through a Spiking Neuron,"Charles Stevens, Anthony Zador",2,"While  it  is  generally  agreed  that  neurons  transmit  information  about their synaptic inputs through spike trains, the code by which  this  information is  transmitted  is  not  well  understood.  An  upper  bound  on  the  information  encoded  is  obtained  by  hypothesizing  that the precise  timing of each spike conveys information.  Here  we  develop  a  general  approach  to quantifying the information carried  by  spike  trains  under  this  hypothesis,  and  apply  it  to  the  leaky  integrate-and-fire  (IF)  model  of  neuronal  dynamics.  We  formu(cid:173) late  the  problem  in  terms  of the  probability  distribution  peT)  of  interspike  intervals  (ISIs),  assuming that  spikes  are  detected  with  arbitrary  but finite  temporal resolution .  In  the  absence  of added  noise,  all  the  variability in  the  ISIs  could encode  information, and  the  information rate  is  simply the entropy of the lSI  distribution,  H (T)  =  (-p(T) log2 p(T)},  times  the  spike  rate.  H (T)  thus  pro(cid:173) vides  an  exact  expression  for  the  information rate.  The  methods  developed  here  can be  used  to determine experimentally the infor(cid:173) mation carried  by  spike  trains,  even  when  the  lower  bound of the  information rate  provided  by  the  stimulus reconstruction  method  is  not  tight.  In  a  preliminary series  of experiments,  we  have  used  these  methods  to estimate information rates of hippocampal neu(cid:173) rons  in  slice  in  response  to somatic  current  injection.  These  pilot  experiments suggest  information rates as  high as  6.3  bits/spike. ",0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1995/file/fd2c5e4680d9a01dba3aada5ece22270-Paper.pdf

On  the  other  hand,  it can also  be  used  for  sequential  data,  when  some of the  input variables are missing or are available at different frequencies.  Unlike in the  case of probabilistic models (e.g.  Gaussian) of the missing variables, the network  does  not  attempt  to  model the  distribution  of the  missmg  variables given  the  observed variables.  Instead it is a  more ""discriminant"" approach that fills  in the  missing variables for  the sole purpose of minimizing a  learning criterion  (e.g.,  to  minimize an output error).",0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1995/file/ffeed84c7cb1ae7bf4ec4bd78275bb98-Paper.pdf
