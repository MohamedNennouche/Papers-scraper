1988,Neural Control of Sensory Acquisition: The Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex,"Michael Paulin, Mark Nelson, James Bower",3,"We present a new hypothesis that the cerebellum plays a key role in ac(cid:173) tively controlling the acquisition of sensory infonnation by the nervous  system.  In this paper we explore this idea by examining the function of  a  simple  cerebellar-related  behavior,  the  vestibula-ocular  reflex  or  VOR, in  which  eye movements  are generated to minimize image slip  on  the  retina  during  rapid  head  movements.  Considering  this  system  from  the point of view of statistical estimation theory, our results  sug(cid:173) gest that the transfer function of the VOR, often regarded as a static or  slowly  modifiable  feature  of the  system,  should  actually  be  continu(cid:173) ously and rapidly changed during head movements. We further suggest  that these changes are under the direct control of the cerebellar cortex  and propose experiments to test this hypothesis.",0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1988/file/006f52e9102a8d3be2fe5614f42ba989-Paper.pdf
1988,Modeling the Olfactory Bulb - Coupled Nonlinear Oscillators,"Zhaoping Li, John J. Hopfield",2,"The olfactory  bulb of mammals  aids  in  the  discrimination  of  odors.  A  mathematical  model  based  on  the  bulbar  anatomy  and  electrophysiology  is  described.  Simulations  produce  a  35-60  Hz  modulated activity coherent across the bulb, mimicing the observed  field  potentials.  The  decision  states  (for  the  odor  information)  here  can  be  thought  of as  stable  cycles,  rather  than  point  stable  states  typical  of simpler  neuro-computing  models.  Analysis  and  simulations show that a  group of coupled non-linear oscillators are  responsible for the oscillatory activities determined by the odor in(cid:173) put, and that the bulb, with appropriate inputs from higher centers,  can  enhance  or suppress  the  sensitivity  to  partiCUlar  odors.  The  model provides a framework  in which to understand the transform  between odor input and the bulbar output to olfactory cortex.",0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1988/file/013d407166ec4fa56eb1e1f8cbe183b9-Paper.pdf

1988,The Boltzmann Perceptron Network: A Multi-Layered Feed-Forward Network Equivalent to the Boltzmann Machine,"Eyal Yair, Allen Gersho",2,"The  concept  of  the  stochastic  Boltzmann  machine  (BM)  is  auractive  for  decision  making  and  pattern  classification  purposes  since  the  probability  of  attaining  the network  states  is a  function  of the network energy.  Hence,  the  probability of attaining particular energy minima  may be associated  with  the  probabilities  of  making  certain  decisions  (or  classifications).  However,  because of its stochastic  nature,  the complexity of the BM is fairly  high and  therefore  such  networks  are  not  very  likely  to  be  used  in  practice.  In  this  paper  we  suggest  a  way  to  alleviate  this  drawback  by  converting  the  sto(cid:173) chastic  BM into  a  deterministic  network  which  we  call  the  Boltzmann  Per(cid:173) ceptron  Network  (BPN).  The BPN is functionally  equivalent  to  the  BM but  has  a  feed-forward  structure  and  low  complexity.  No annealing  is required.  The  conditions  under  which  such  a  convmion  is  feasible  are  given.  A  learning  algorithm  for  the  BPN based  on  the  conjugate  gradient  method  is  also provided which is somewhat akin  to the backpropagation algorithm.",0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1988/file/045117b0e0a11a242b9765e79cbf113f-Paper.pdf

1988,Links Between Markov Models and Multilayer Perceptrons,"Herv√© Bourlard, C. J. Wellekens",2,"Hidden Markov models are widely used for automatic speech recog(cid:173) nition. They inherently incorporate the sequential character of the  speech signal and are statistically trained. However, the a-priori  choice of the model topology limits their flexibility. Another draw(cid:173) back of these models is their weak discriminating power. Multilayer  perceptrons are now promising tools in the connectionist approach  for classification problems and have already been successfully tested  on speech recognition problems. However, the sequential nature of  the speech signal remains difficult to handle in that kind of ma(cid:173) chine.

1988,Skeletonization: A Technique for Trimming the Fat from a Network via Relevance Assessment,"Michael C. Mozer, Paul Smolensky",2,"This paper proposes a means of using the knowledge in a network to  determine the functionality or relevance of individual units, both for  the purpose of understanding the network's behavior and improving its  performance. The basic idea is to iteratively train the network to a cer(cid:173) tain performance criterion, compute a measure of relevance that identi(cid:173) fies which input or hidden units are most critical to performance, and  automatically trim the least relevant units. This skeletonization tech(cid:173) nique can be used to simplify networks by eliminating units that con(cid:173) vey redundant information; to improve learning performance by first  learning with spare hidden units and then trimming the unnecessary  ones away, thereby constraining generalization; and to understand the  behavior of networks in terms of minimal ""rules.""",0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1988/file/07e1cd7dca89a1678042477183b7ac3f-Paper.pdf

1988,Automatic Local Annealing,Jared Leinbach,1,This research involves a method for finding global maxima  in  constraint  satisfaction  networks.  It  is  an  annealing  process  butt  unlike  most  otherst  requires  no  annealing  schedule.  Temperature  is  instead  determined  locally  by  units at each updatet and thus all processing is done at the  unit  level.  There  are  two  major  practical  benefits  to  processing  this  way:  1)  processing  can continue  in  'bad t  areas of the networkt while 'good t areas remain stablet and  2)  processing  continues  in  the  'bad t  areast as  long  as  the  constraints  remain  poorly  satisfied  (i.e.  it  does  not  stop  after  some  predetermined  number of cycles).

We show how to exploit the machine's  ability to escape local minima, in order to use it, at a constant  temperature, for unambiguous associative pattern-retrieval in noisy  environments. An association rule, which creates a sphere of influence  around each stored pattern, is used along with the Machine's dynamics  to match the machine's noisy input with one of the pre-stored patterns.  Spurious fIxed points, whose regions of attraction are not recognized by  the rule, are skipped, due to the Machine's fInite probability to escape  from any state. The results apply to the Boltzmann machine and to the  asynchronous net of binary threshold elements (Hopfield model').

The lower level  is  a  two-dimensional  diffusion map which  accepts  visual  features  as  input, and spreads activity over larger scales as a function of time. The  upper layer is periodically fed the  activity from  the diffusion layer and  locates local maxima in it (an extreme form  of contrast enhancement)  using a network of local comparators.

1988,Storing Covariance by the Associative Long-Term Potentiation and Depression of Synaptic Strengths in the Hippocampus,"Patric Stanton, Terrence J. Sejnowski",2,"In modeling studies or memory based on neural networks, both the selective  enhancement and depression or synaptic strengths are required ror effident storage  or inrormation (Sejnowski, 1977a,b; Kohonen, 1984; Bienenstock et aI, 1982;  Sejnowski and Tesauro, 1989). We have tested this assumption in the hippocampus,  a cortical structure or the brain that is involved in long-term memory. A brier,  high-frequency activation or excitatory synapses in the hippocampus produces an  increase in synaptic strength known as long-term potentiation, or L TP (BUss and  Lomo, 1973), that can last ror many days. LTP is known to be Hebbian since it  requires the simultaneous release or neurotransmitter from presynaptic terminals  coupled with postsynaptic depolarization (Kelso et al, 1986; Malinow and Miller,  1986; Gustatrson et al, 1987). However, a mechanism ror the persistent reduction or  synaptic strength that could balance LTP has not yet been demonstrated. We stu(cid:173) died the associative interactions between separate inputs onto the same dendritic  trees or hippocampal pyramidal cells or field CAl, and round that a low-frequency  input which, by itselr, does not persistently change synaptic strength, can either  increase (associative L TP) or decrease in strength (associative long-term depression  or LTD) depending upon whether it is positively or negatively correlated in time  with a second, high-frequency bursting input. LTP or synaptic strength is Hebbian,  and LTD is anti-Hebbian since it is elicited by pairing presynaptic firing with post(cid:173) synaptic hyperpolarization sufficient to block postsynaptic activity.
