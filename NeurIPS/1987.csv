1987,Bit-Serial Neural Networks,"Alan Murray, Anthony Smith, Zoe Butler",3,"A  bit  - serial  VLSI  neural  network  is  described  from  an  initial  architecture  for  a  synapse array through to silicon layout and board design.  The issues surrounding bit  - serial  computation,  and  analog/digital  arithmetic  are  discussed  and  the  parallel  development  of  a  hybrid  analog/digital  neural  network  is  outlined.  Learning  and  recall  capabilities  are  reported  for  the  bit  - serial  network  along  with  a  projected  specification  for  a  64  - neuron,  bit  - serial  board  operating  at 20 MHz.

1987,Connectivity Versus Entropy,Yaser Abu-Mostafa,1,"How  does  the  connectivity  of a  neural  network  (number  of synapses  per  neuron)  relate  to  the complexity  of the  problems  it  can  handle  (measured  by  the entropy)?  Switching theory would suggest no relation at all, since all Boolean  functions  can be  implemented  using  a  circuit  with very  low  connectivity  (e.g.,  using  two-input  NAND  gates).  However,  for  a  network  that  learns  a  problem  from  examples  using  a  local  learning  rule,  we  prove  that  the  entropy  of  the  problem becomes  a  lower  bound for  the connectivity of the network.",0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1987/file/03afdbd66e7929b125f8597834fa83a4-Paper.pdf

1987,How Neural Nets Work,"Alan Lapedes, Robert Farber",2,"There is  presently great interest in the abilities of neural networks to mimic 
""qualitative reasoning""  by manipulating neural incodings of symbols.  Less work 
has  been performed on using neural networks to process floating  point numbers 
and it is  sometimes stated that neural networks are somehow inherently inaccu(cid:173)
rate  and  therefore  best  suited  for  ""fuzzy""  qualitative reasoning.  Nevertheless, 
the  potential  speed  of massively  parallel  operations  make  neural  net  ""number 
crunching""  an interesting topic  to explore.  In this paper we  discuss some of our 
work in which we  demonstrate that for  certain applications neural networks can 
achieve  significantly  higher  numerical  accuracy  than  more  conventional  tech(cid:173)
niques.  In  particular,  prediction  of future  values  of a  chaotic  time  series  can 
be  performed  with  exceptionally  high  accuracy.  We  analyze  how  a  neural  net 
is  able  to do  this  ,  and in  the process  show  that  a  large class  of functions  from 
Rn.  ~ Rffl  may  be  accurately  approximated  by  a  backpropagation  neural  net 
with just two  ""hidden""  layers.  The network  uses  this functional  approximation 
to perform either interpolation (signal processing applications)  or extrapolation 
(symbol processing applicationsJ.  Neural nets therefore use quite familiar meth(cid:173)

be a  useful  approach  to analyzing  neural  network  operation  and  relates  neural 
networks  to well  studied topics  in  functional  approximation.",0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1987/file/093f65e080a295f8076b1c5722a46aa2-Paper.pdf

Space(cid:173) organizational  properties  of  neural  nets  are  very  relevant  in  image  modeling  and  pattern  analysis,  where  spatial  computations  on  stocha(cid:173) stic  two-dimensional  image  fields  are  involved.

1987,REFLEXIVE ASSOCIATIVE MEMORIES,Hendricus G. Loos,1,"In the synchronous discrete model, the average memory capacity of  bidirectional associative memories (BAMs) is compared with that of  Hopfield memories, by means of a calculat10n of the percentage of good  recall for 100 random BAMs of dimension 64x64, for different numbers  of stored vectors. The memory capac1ty Is found to be much smal1er than  the Kosko upper bound, which Is the lesser of the two dimensions of the  BAM. On the average, a 64x64 BAM has about 68 % of the capacity of the  corresponding Hopfield memory with the same number of neurons. Ortho(cid:173) normal coding of the BAM Increases the effective storage capaCity by  only 25 %. The memory capacity limitations are due to spurious stable  states, which arise In BAMs In much the same way as in Hopfleld  memories. Occurrence of spurious stable states can be avoided by  replacing the thresholding in the backlayer of the BAM by another  nonl1near process, here called ""Dominant Label Selection"" (DLS). The  simplest DLS is the wlnner-take-all net, which gives a fault-sensitive  memory. Fault tolerance can be improved by the use of an orthogonal or  unitary transformation. An optical application of the latter is a Fourier  transform, which is implemented simply by a lens.",0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1987/file/2838023a778dfaecdc212708f721b788-Paper.pdf

1987,Neural Net and Traditional Classifiers,"William Huang, Richard P. Lippmann",2,"Abstract.  Previous  work on  nets  with  continuous-valued inputs  led  to generative 
procedures  to construct convex decision  regions with two-layer perceptrons (one hidden 
layer) and  arbitrary decision  regions  with  three-layer perceptrons  (two hidden layers). 
Here we demonstrate that two-layer perceptron classifiers trained with back propagation 
can  form  both  convex  and  disjoint  decision  regions.  Such  classifiers  are  robust,  train 
rapidly,  and  provide  good  performance  with  simple  decision  regions.  When  complex 
decision  regions  are  required,  however,  convergence  time  can  be  excessively  long  and 
performance is  often no better than that of k-nearest  neighbor classifiers.  Three neural 
net  classifiers  are  presented  that  provide  more  rapid  training  under  such  situations. 
Two use  fixed  weights in  the  first  one  or  two layers and  are  similar  to classifiers  that 
estimate probability density functions using histograms.  A third ""feature map classifier"" 
uses  both  unsupervised  and  supervised  training.  It provides  good  performance  with 
little supervised training in situations such as speech recognition where much unlabeled 
training data is  available.  The architecture of this classifier can  be  used  to implement 
a  neural net  k-nearest  neighbor classifier.",0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1987/file/4e732ced3463d06de0ca9a15b6153677-Paper.pdf

1987,Analysis of Distributed Representation of Constituent Structure in Connectionist Systems,Paul Smolensky,1,"A  general  method, the  tensor product representation, is described for  the distributed representation of  value/variable bindings.  The method allows the fully distributed representation of symbolic structures:  the roles  in  the structures, as well as the fillers  for  those roles, can be arbitrarily non-local.  Fully and  partially localized  special cases reduce to existing cases of connectionist representations of structured  data;  the  tensor  product  representation  generalizes  these  and  the  few  existing  examples  of  fuUy  distributed  representations  of structures.  The  representation  saturates  gracefully  as  larger  structures  are  represented;  it penn its  recursive  construction  of complex  representations  from  simpler  ones;  it  respects  the  independence  of the  capacities  to generate and  maintain  multiple bindings in  parallel;  it  extends naturally to continuous structures and continuous representational patterns; it pennits values to  also  serve  as  variables;  it  enables  analysis  of  the  interference  of  symbolic  structures  stored  in  associative  memories;  and  it  leads  to characterization  of optimal  distributed representations  of roles  and a recirculation algorithm for learning them.",0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1987/file/66f041e16a60928b05a7e228a89c3799-Paper.pdf

1987,On the Power of Neural Networks for Solving Hard Problems,"Jehoshua Bruck, Joseph Goodman",2,"This  paper deals  with a  neural network model in  which each neuron  performs a  threshold logic function.  An important property of the model  is  that  it always  converges  to a  stable state  when  operating in  a  serial  mode [2,5].  This property is  the basis of the potential applications of the  model such as associative memory devices and combinatorial optimization  [3,6].  One of the motivations for use of the model for solving hard combinatorial  problems  is  the fact  that it can  be implemented  by optical devices  and  thus operate at a  higher speed  than conventional electronics.  The main theme in this work is  to investigate the power of the model for  solving NP-hard problems  [4,8],  and to understand  the relation  between  speed of operation and the size of a  neural network.  In particular, it will  be  shown  that  for  any  NP-hard  problem  the  existence  of a  polynomial  size  network  that  solves  it  implies  that  NP=co-NP.  Also,  for  Traveling  Salesman  Problem  (TSP), even  a  polynomial  size  network  that  gets  an  €-approximate  solution does  not exist unless  P=NP.

Additional  synaptic  noise broadens  the peak,  but the  peak  area  -- i.e.,  the  number of above-chance firings triggered per EPSP -- remains proportional to  the EPSP  amplitude.  A typical EPSP of 100  ~v triggers about .01  firings per  EPSP.  The  consequences  of  these  data  for  information  processing  by  polysynaptic connections is discussed.

Several techniques based on communication theory are presented that improve the robust(cid:173) ness of the network in the face of sparse, local interconnect structures. Also discussed are  some potential problems when information is distributed too widely.",0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1987/file/d82c8d1619ad8176d665453cfb2e55f0-Paper.pdf
1987,Performance Measures for Associative Memories that Learn and Forget,Anthony Kuh,1,"Recently,  many  modifications  to  the  McCulloch/Pitts  model  have  been  proposed  where  both  learning  and  forgetting  occur.  Given  that  the  network  never saturates  (ceases  to  function  effectively  due  to  an  overload  of  information),  the  learning  updates  can  con(cid:173) tinue indefinitely.  For these networks,  we  need  to introduce  performance  measmes in  addi(cid:173) tion  to  the  information  capacity  to  evaluate  the  different  networks.  We  mathematically  define  quantities such  as  the  plasticity  of  a  network,  the  efficacy  of an  information  vector,  and the  probability  of network  saturation.  From  these  quantities  we  analytically  compare  different networks.",0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1987/file/d9d4f495e875a2e075a1a4a6e1b9770f-Paper.pdf
1987,Centric Models of the Orientation Map in Primary Visual Cortex,"William Baxter, Bruce Dow",2,"In  the  visual  cortex  of  the  monkey  the  horizontal  organization  of  the  preferred  orientations of orientation-selective  cells  follows  two opposing  rules:  1) neighbors  tend  to  have similar orientation preferences, and  2) many different orientations are  observed  in a  local  region.  Several  orientation  models  which satisfy these  constraints are found  to  differ  in  the spacing  and  the  topological  index  of their singularities.  Using  the  rate  of orientation change as  a  measure,  the  models  are  compared to published experimental  results.",0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1987/file/e2c420d928d4bf8ce0ff2ec19b371514-Paper.pdf
1987,A Computer Simulation of Olfactory Cortex with Functional Implications for Storage and Retrieval of Olfactory Information,"James Bower, Matthew Wilson",2,"Based  on  anatomical  and  physiological  data,  we  have  developed  a  computer  simulation  of piri(cid:173) form  (olfactory)  cortex  which  is  capable  of reproducing  spatial  and  temporal  patterns  of actual  cortical  activity  under  a  variety  of conditions.  Using  a  simple  Hebb-type  learning  rule  in  conjunc(cid:173) tion  with  the  cortical  dynamics  which  emerge  from  the  anatomical  and  physiological  organiza(cid:173) tion  of  the  model,  the  simulations  are  capable  of establishing  cortical  representations  for  differ(cid:173) ent  input  patterns.  The  basis  of  these  representations  lies  in  the  interaction  of  sparsely  distribut(cid:173) ed,  highly  divergent/convergent  interconnections  between  modeled  neurons.  We  have  shown  that  different  representations  can  be  stored  with  minimal  interference.  and  that  following  learning  these  representations  are  resistant  to  input  degradation,  allowing  reconstruction  of  a  representa(cid:173) tion  following  only  a  partial  presentation  of  an  original  training  stimulus.  Further,  we  have  demonstrated  that  the  degree  of  overlap  of  cortical  representations  for  different  stimuli  can  also  be  modulated.  For  instance  similar  input  patterns  can  be  induced  to generate  distinct  cortical  representations  (discrimination).  while  dissimilar  inputs  can  be  induced  to  generate  overlapping  representations  (accommodation).  Both  features  are  presumably  important  in  classifying  olfacto(cid:173) ry stimuli.",0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1987/file/e369853df766fa44e1ed0ff613f563bd-Paper.pdf
1987,Towards an Organizing Principle for a Layered Perceptual Network,Ralph Linsker,1,"An information-theoretic optimization principle is  proposed for  the development  of  each  processing  stage  of  a  multilayered  perceptual  network.  This  principle  of  ""maximum information preservation""  states that the signal transformation that is to be  realized at each stage is one that maximizes the information that the output signal values  (from that stage) convey about the input signals values (to that stage), subject to certain  constraints and in  the presence of processing noise.  The quantity being maximized is  a  Shannon information rate.  I provide motivation for this principle and -- for some simple  model cases -- derive some of its consequences, discuss an algorithmic implementation,  and  show  how  the  principle  may  lead  to  biologically  relevant  neural  architectural  features  such  as  topographic  maps,  map  distortions,  orientation  selectivity,  and  extraction of spatial and temporal signal correlations.  A  possible  connection between  this  information-theoretic principle  and  a  principle  of minimum  entropy production in  nonequilibrium thermodynamics is suggested.",0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1987/file/e4da3b7fbbce2345d7772b0674a318d5-Paper.pdf
