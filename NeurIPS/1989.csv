1989,Training Stochastic Model Recognition Algorithms as Networks can Lead to Maximum Mutual Information Estimation of Parameters,John Bridle,1,"One  of the  attractions  of neural  network  approaches  to  pattern  recognition  is  the  use  of a  discrimination-based  training  method.  We  show  that once  we  have  modified  the  output  layer  of a  multi(cid:173) layer perceptron to provide mathematically correct  probability dis(cid:173) tributions,  and  replaced  the  usual  squared  error  criterion  with  a  probability-based score,  the  result  is equivalent  to  Maximum  Mu(cid:173) tual  Information training,  which  has  been  used  successfully  to im(cid:173) prove  the  performance  of hidden  Markov models for  speech  recog(cid:173) nition.  If the network is specially constructed to perform the recog(cid:173) nition computations of a  given kind of stochastic model based clas(cid:173) sifier  then we  obtain a  method for  discrimination-based training of  the  parameters  of the  models.

1989,Can Simple Cells Learn Curves? A Hebbian Model in a Structured Environment,"William Softky, Daniel Kammen",2,"In the mammalian visual cortex,  orientation-selective 'simple cells'  which detect  straight lines  may be adapted  to detect  curved  lines  instead.  We  test  a  biologically  plausible,  Hebbian,  single-neuron  model,  which learns oriented receptive fields  upon exposure  to un(cid:173) structured (noise) input and maintains orientation selectivity upon  exposure  to  edges  or  bars  of all  orientations  and  positions.  This  model  can  also  learn  arc-shaped  receptive  fields  upon  exposure  to an environment of only  circular  rings.  Thus,  new  experiments  which try to induce an abnormal (curved) receptive field  may pro(cid:173) vide insight into the plasticity of simple cells.  The model suggests  that exposing  cells  to only  a  single  spatial  frequency  may induce  more  striking spatial frequency  and  orientation  dependent effects  than heretofore observed.",0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1989/file/03c6b06952c750899bb03d998e631860-Paper.pdf

Sejnowski",3,"Interneurons in leech ganglia receive multiple sensory inputs and make  synaptic contacts with many motor neurons. These ""hidden"" units  coordinate several different behaviors. We used physiological and  anatomical constraints to construct a model of the local bending reflex.  Dynamical networks were trained on experimentally derived input-output  patterns using recurrent back-propagation. Units in the model were  modified to include electrical synapses and multiple synaptic time  constants. The properties of the hidden units that emerged in the  simulations matched those in the leech.

1989,A Computer Modeling Approach to Understanding the Inferior Olive and Its Relationships to the Cerebellar Cortex in Rats,"Maurice Lee, James Bower",2,"This paper presents the results of a simulation of the spatial relationship  between the inferior olivary nucleus and  folium  crus IIA of the lateral  hemisphere  of  the  rat  cerebellum.  The  principal  objective  of  this  modeling effort was to resolve an apparent conflict between a proposed  zonal organization of olivary projections to cerebellar cortex suggested  by  anatomical  tract-tracing  experiments  (Brodal  &  Kawamura  1980;  Campbell & Armstrong  1983) and a more patchy organization apparent  with physiological mapping (Robertson  1987).  The results suggest that  several unique features  of the olivocerebellar circuit may contribute to  the appearance of zonal organization using anatomical  techniques, but  that  the  detailed  patterns  of  patchy  tactile  projections  seen  with  physiological  techniques  are  a  more  accurate  representation  of  the  afferent organization of this region of cortex.",0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1989/file/084b6fbb10729ed4da8c3d3f5a3ae7c9-Paper.pdf
1989,Generalization and Scaling in Reinforcement Learning,"David Ackley, Michael Littman",2,"In  associative reinforcement learning,  an environment generates input  vectors, a  learning system generates possible output vectors, and a  re(cid:173) inforcement function computes feedback signals from the input-output  pairs.  The  task is  to discover  and  remember  input-output  pairs  that  generate  rewards.  Especially  difficult  cases  occur  when  rewards  are  rare, since the expected time for any algorithm can grow exponentially  with the size  of the problem.  Nonetheless, if a  reinforcement function  possesses regularities, and a learning algorithm exploits them, learning  time  can be reduced  below that  of non-generalizing  algorithms.

Firing correlations  between cells  in  the  input  layer  were  found  to  modulate  the  transmission  of  FM  sig(cid:173) nals  under  certain dynamical  conditions.  A  tonic  level  of activity  was  maintained  by  providing  each  cell  with  a  source  of Poisson(cid:173) distributed  synaptic  input.  When  the  average  membrane  depo(cid:173) larization  produced  by  the  synaptic  input  was  sufficiently  below  threshold,  the  firing  correlations  between  cells  in  the  input  layer  could greatly amplify the signal present in subsequent layers.  When  the  depolarization was sufficiently close  to threshold,  however,  the  firing  synchrony  between cells  in the  initial layers could  no  longer  effect  the propagation of FM  signals.

1989,Acoustic-Imaging Computations by Echolocating Bats: Unification of Diversely-Represented Stimulus Features into Whole Images,James Simmons,1,"The  echolocating  bat,  Eptesicus fuscus,  perceives  the  distance  to  sonar  targets  from  the  delay  of echoes  and  the  shape  of targets  from  the  spectrum  of echoes.  However,  shape  is  perceived  in  terms  of the  target's  range  proftle.  The  time  separation  of echo  components from  parts of the target located at  different  distances  is  reconstructed  from  the  echo  spectrum  and  added  to  the  estimate  of absolute  delay  already  derived  from  the  arrival-time  of  echoes.  The  bat  thus  perceives  the  distance  to  targets  and  range  depth  within  dimension,  which  is  computed.  The  image  corresponds  to  the  crosscorrelation  function  of  echoes.  Fusion  of  physiologically  distinct  time- and  frequency-domain  representations  into  a  fmal,  common  time-domain  image  illustrates  the  binding  of  within(cid:173) modality  features  into  a  unified,  whole  image.

This implementation runs at about 180  million  interconnections per second  (IPS)  on a  64K  processor  CM- 2.  The  main  interprocessor  communication operation  used  is  2D  nearest  neighbor  communication.  The  techniques  developed  here  can  be  easily  extended  to implement  other algorithms for  layered  neural nets on  the CM-2,  or on other massively parallel computers  which have 2D or higher degree connections among their processors.",0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1989/file/e3796ae838835da0b6f6ea37bcf8bcb7-Paper.pdf

1989,The Cocktail Party Problem: Speech/Data Signal Separation Comparison between Backpropagation and SONN,"John Kassebaum, Manoel Tenorio, Christoph Schaefers",3,"This  work  introduces  a  new  method  called  Self  Organizing  Neural  Network  (SONN)  algorithm  and  compares  its  performance  with Back  Propagation  in  a  signal  separation  application.  The  problem  is  to  separate  two  signals;  a  modem  data signal  and  a  male  speech  signal,  added and transmitted  through  a  4 khz  channel.  The signals  are sam(cid:173) pled  at  8  khz,  and  using  supervised  learning,  an  attempt  is  made  to  reconstruct  them.  The  SONN  is  an  algorithm  that  constructs  its  own  network  topology  during  training,  which  is  shown  to  be  much  smaller  than  the  BP  network,  faster  to  trained,  and  free  from  the  trial-and(cid:173) error network design that characterize BP.",0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1989/file/e56954b4f6347e897f954495eab16a88-Paper.pdf

1989,The CHIR Algorithm for Feed Forward Networks with Binary Weights,Tal Grossman,1,"A new learning algorithm, Learning by Choice of Internal Rep(cid:173) resetations  (CHIR), was  recently introduced.  Whereas many algo(cid:173) rithms  reduce  the  learning  process  to  minimizing a  cost  function  over the  weights, our method treats the  internal representations as  the fundamental entities to  be determined.  The algorithm applies  a  search  procedure  in the  space  of internal representations,  and  a  cooperative adaptation of the weights (e.g.  by using the perceptron  learning rule).  Since the introduction of its basic, single output ver(cid:173) sion, the CHIR algorithm was generalized to train any feed  forward  network of binary neurons.  Here we present the generalised version  of the  CHIR algorithm,  and further  demonstrate  its  versatility by  describing  how it can  be  modified  in order  to  train networks with  binary  (±1)  weights.  Preliminary  tests  of this  binary  version  on  the random teacher  problem are  also  reported.",0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1989/file/eae27d77ca20db309e056e3d2dcd7d69-Paper.pdf
1989,A Large-Scale Neural Network Which Recognizes Handwritten Kanji Characters,"Yoshihiro Mori, Kazuki Joe",2,"We propose a  new  way  to construct a  large-scale neural  network  for  3.000 handwritten  Kanji  characters  recognition.  This  neural  network  consists  of 3  parts:  a  collection  of small-scale  networks  which  are  trained individually on a small number of Kanji characters; a network  which  integrates  the  output  from  the  small-scale  networks,  and  a  process to facilitate  the integration of these neworks. The recognition  rate of the  total  system  is  comparable  with  those  of the  small-scale  networks. Our results indicate that the proposed method is effective for  constructing  a  large-scale  network  without  loss  of  recognition  performance.",0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1989/file/eb163727917cbba1eea208541a643e74-Paper.pdf

This  14-neuron  network  is  modulated  by  many  inputs.  These inputs reconfigure  the  network  to  produce  multiple  output  patterns  by  three  simple  mechanisms:  1) detennining which  cells are active; 2) modulating the  synaptic  efficacy;  3)  changing  the  intrinsic  response  properties  of  individual  neurons.  The importance of modifiable  intrinsic  response  properties of neurons for network function and modulation is discussed.,0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1989/file/ec8ce6abb3e952a85b8551ba726a1227-Paper.pdf
1989,Recognizing Hand-Printed Letters and Digits,"Gale Martin, James Pittman",2,"We are developing a hand-printed character recognition system using a multi(cid:173) layered neural net trained through backpropagation.  We report on results of  training nets with samples of hand-printed digits scanned off of bank checks  and hand-printed letters interactively entered into a computer through a sty(cid:173) lus digitizer.  Given a large training set,  and a net with sufficient capacity to  achieve  high performance on the training set,  nets  typically achieved error  rates of 4-5% at a 0% reject rate and 1-2% at a 10% reject rate.  The topology  and capacity of the system, as measured by the number of connections in the  net,  have  surprisingly little effect on generalization.  For those  developing  practical pattern recognition systems,  these results suggest that a large and  representative  training  sample  may be  the single,  most important factor in  achieving high recognition accuracy.  From a scientific standpoint, these re(cid:173) sults raise doubts about the relevance to backpropagation of learning models  that estimate the likelihood of high generalization from estimates of capacity.  Reducing capacity does have other benefits however, especially when the re(cid:173) duction is  accomplished by using local receptive fields  with shared weights.  In this latter case, we find the net evolves feature detectors resembling those  in visual cortex and Linsker's orientation-selective nodes.

Hinton",3,"We  describe a model that can recognize  two-dimensional shapes in  an  unsegmented  image,  independent  of their orientation,  position,  and scale.  The model,  called TRAFFIC, efficiently  represents  the  structural  relation  between  an  object  and  each  of its  component  features  by  encoding  the fixed  viewpoint-invariant transformation  from the feature's reference frame to the object's in the weights of a  connectionist  network.  Using  a  hierarchy  of such  transformations,  with increasing complexity of features  at each successive  layer,  the  network  can  recognize  multiple objects  in parallel.  An implemen(cid:173) tation  of TRAFFIC  is  described,  along with  experimental  results  demonstrating  the  network's  ability to  recognize  constellations  of  stars in  a viewpoint-invariant manner.",0,https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/1989/file/f340f1b1f65b6df5b5e3f94d95b11daf-Paper.pdf
